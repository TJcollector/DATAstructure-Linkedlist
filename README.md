# DATAstructure-Linkedlist
Exploring how LinkedList works, specifically, Deque creating from scratch, In other words, there will be no built-in function to help us to create the Deque-LinkedList. Our goal is to deeply understand the recursion behind this data structures. We will be using Java as our coding language for this project

According to the Wikipedia, "In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence."
